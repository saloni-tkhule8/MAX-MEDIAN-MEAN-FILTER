# MAX-MEDIAN-MEAN-FILTER

A median filter is a nonlinear digital filtering technique used 
in image processing to reduce noise while preserving edges. 
It is particularly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise (impulse noise).


A max filter is a type of nonlinear filter used in image processing,
primarily for noise removal and enhancement. It replaces each pixel in
an image with the maximum value from its neighborhood, making it 
particularly useful for brightening images and removing black (dark) noise.


A mean filter (also called an average filter) is a simple and commonly used
linear filter in image processing. It is mainly used for smoothing images and
reducing noise by replacing each pixel's value with the average of its neighbors.
